# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree
## Introductory Project: Diagonal Sudoku Solver

# Question 1 (Naked Twins)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the naked twins problem?  
A: We do the following:

We identify the twins contained in each unit and then apply the constraint: no other box can contain the twin values. Therefore, we eliminate any boxes in the same unit as the twins which contain the twin values.

# Question 2 (Diagonal Sudoku)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the diagonal sudoku problem?  
A: We find the boxes for the diagonal units and apply the eliminate(), naked_twins(), and only_choice() methods.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3**.

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.
Please try using the environment we provided in the Anaconda lesson of the Nanodegree.
